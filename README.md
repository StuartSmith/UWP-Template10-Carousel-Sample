# UWP Template10 Carousel Example
<p>
Example of a Caoursel Control using Microsofts Template 10
</p>

The orginal code for this sample can be found on Jerry Nixon's blog. The example has been update to use x:bind from windows 10 and use the Delegate command found in Template 10. The code can probably be encapsulated into a control. But because of time etc I have left that up to the next user of this control.
